RetroPick – High-Speed Cross‑Chain Prediction Market Architecture & Value Proposition
Strategic Tracks Focus for RetroPick
After evaluating all hackathon sponsor tracks, RetroPick will strategically target three key tracks that best align with its vision of a fast, user-friendly prediction market:
•	Yellow Network (Off-Chain Speed & Scale): RetroPick leverages Yellow’s state-channel Layer-2 network to achieve instant, gasless transactions. This track is crucial because a prediction market demands high-frequency interactions (trades, bets) without the delays and costs of on-chain transactions. Yellow’s protocol lets users “deposit crypto once and make lightning-fast transactions” off-chain with final on-chain settlement[1]. In practice, this means a user can place dozens of bets in seconds without paying gas each time, and only two on-chain transactions (deposit and settle) are needed – similar to Yellow’s chess game analogy where 40+ on-chain moves (costing $100s in gas) can be reduced to 2 transactions via a state channel[2]. By focusing on Yellow’s track, RetroPick ensures a Web2-like speed for a Web3 prediction market, aligning with Yellow’s goal of real-time, gas-free user actions with Web3 security[3][4].
•	Arc (Circle’s Cross-Chain USDC Hub): RetroPick will deploy on Arc, Circle’s EVM-compatible L1 built for stablecoin finance, to tap into cross-chain liquidity with USDC. This track is strategic because RetroPick aims to serve users from any chain without fragmenting liquidity or user experience. Arc is “purpose-built to support financial transactions around stablecoins” and has native integration with Circle’s cross-chain protocols (CCTP and Gateway) to easily bridge USDC liquidity across Arc and other chains[5]. By using Arc as the settlement layer, RetroPick can treat multiple blockchains as one unified market – users on different networks can all join the same prediction pool by moving funds into Arc, then withdraw back to their chain of choice. This aligns perfectly with Arc’s prize theme of “apps that treat multiple chains as one liquidity surface, moving USDC wherever needed without fragmenting UX”. Arc’s design addresses fragmented liquidity and enables almost instantaneous movement of dollars across chains[6][7], which is exactly what RetroPick needs to aggregate a global user base into one market. Additionally, Arc’s deterministic finality and USDC-native gas model provide a stable, low-friction environment for on-chain settlements.
•	ENS (User Experience & Identity Layer): To round out the product, RetroPick will integrate Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for improved UX and a shot at the ENS track. ENS brings “decentralized naming for the new internet” – replacing 0x wallet addresses with human-readable names and portable profiles[8]. This integration is strategic but lightweight: it enhances trust and ease-of-use without altering core logic. For example, users can connect with their ENS name (displaying “alice.eth” instead of a hex address), and winners can receive payouts to an ENS name. We can even get creative by using ENS subdomains for markets (e.g. election2026.retropick.eth could point to a market’s data or serve a decentralized front-end via content hash). This demonstrates that ENS isn’t an afterthought, but improves RetroPick’s accessibility – onboarding less-technical users by making Web3 interactions feel more familiar and social (names instead of numbers)[8]. Such an ENS integration not only qualifies for the “Integrate ENS” prize pool but also strengthens RetroPick’s value proposition with a user-friendly identity layer.
By focusing on Yellow + Arc + ENS, RetroPick addresses the core challenges of a decentralized prediction market (speed, liquidity, and usability) while aligning with high-value sponsor tracks. Each of these tracks complements the others: Yellow ensures performance, Arc provides broad liquidity and compliance, and ENS polishes the user experience. This multi-track approach maximizes our chances in the hackathon and creates a more complete product.
RetroPick System Architecture
RetroPick’s architecture is designed to combine off-chain speed with on-chain security across multiple chains. Below is an overview of how the system will be structured and how the components interact:
1. Off-Chain Transaction Layer (Yellow Network)
At the heart of RetroPick’s speed is the Yellow Network’s Nitrolite state-channel protocol. When a user joins RetroPick, they open a state channel session via Yellow: the user’s funds are locked in a smart contract on Arc (the custody contract), and a secure off-chain session is created with Yellow’s nodes. Within this session:
•	Instant Bets & Trades: All prediction market actions (placing a bet, trading outcome shares, etc.) are executed off-chain through Yellow’s network of nodes. These off-chain messages update the users’ balances and market state in real time, with sub-second finality typical for state channels[9]. Users get immediate feedback on their trades (just like a Web2 betting app), because no actual blockchain transactions are happening for each bet – the Yellow nodes keep an authoritative record of the latest state signed by participants.
•	No Gas Fees per Action: Because off-chain operations incur no blockchain fees[3], users can make micro-transactions and high-frequency trades that would be cost-prohibitive on-chain. For example, adjusting your prediction position 20 times in an hour or betting $0.50 on many micro-outcomes is now feasible. This gasless, high-throughput environment is what unlocks new use-cases like in-game or real-time event predictions. (Notably, Yellow’s documentation explicitly calls out prediction markets and high-frequency trading as ideal applications for state channels[4].)
•	Security & Trust: Despite being off-chain, the state channel is trust-minimized. All updates are signed by the participants’ keys, and the Yellow protocol ensures that funds are always recoverable on-chain if something goes wrong[10]. The smart contract on Arc acts as a “safe” holding the funds and will only release them according to the final state that participants agreed to (or through a challenge period dispute if there’s a disagreement). This means RetroPick users get speed without sacrificing the self-custody and security of blockchain – no centralized party can steal or alter the off-chain balances. If a node misbehaved or crashed, users could submit their latest signed state to the Arc contract to reclaim funds[11].
•	Off-Chain Matching & Logic: The prediction market mechanics (order matching, odds calculation, etc.) will be implemented off-chain within the session logic. For example, if RetroPick uses an order-book model for trading shares of an outcome, the matching engine can run in a Clearnode (Yellow node) off-chain, updating user allocations instantly. If it’s a parimutuel or automated market maker model, price updates occur off-chain as users bet. This approach avoids on-chain compute and keeps the UX smooth. The Yellow SDK will help manage this off-chain state coordination and ensure all participants see the same “truth” of the current market state, cryptographically secured.
2. On-Chain Settlement Layer (Arc Network on EVM)
While all the heavy lifting happens off-chain during the live market, Arc serves as the settlement and record layer where final outcomes are materialized:
•	Custody & Channel Contracts: RetroPick will deploy Yellow’s custody/channel smart contracts on Arc. This contract (provided by Yellow’s SDK or implemented to Yellow’s spec) is where users deposit their funds to join a session, and it holds those funds securely during off-chain play. Each user’s initial deposit opens a channel (establishes their off-chain balance) and when the session ends, a settlement function is called to distribute funds according to the final signed state. Arc’s EVM-compatibility makes this straightforward – Yellow is compatible with all EVM chains[12], and Arc is a new EVM chain, so we can integrate without low-level changes. Arc’s high performance and deterministic finality mean settlement transactions will be confirmed quickly and cannot be reorganized (important for predictable payout finalization). Moreover, using USDC as Arc’s native gas token means our users essentially pay fees in the same currency they’re transacting (USDC), simplifying the UX (no need for them to hold a separate ETH/MATIC token just for gas).
•	Prediction Market Contract/Module: In addition to the channel contract, RetroPick may include a smart contract that defines the logic of a prediction market outcome and payout. This could be a simple registry where an admin or an oracle can declare the result of an event, and it interacts with the channel contract to unlock the funds to winners. For the hackathon scope, we might implement a minimal “Market Resolution” contract on Arc: after an event, it takes the final off-chain balances (each user’s profit/loss) and calls the Yellow contract to pay out accordingly (for example, paying winners and returning unused collateral to losers). We will ensure this on-chain step is atomic and trustless – e.g., the resolution contract could verify a valid signed final state from the off-chain channel (using a multi-signature from participants or a predetermined oracle signature) before triggering payouts. This guarantees that on-chain settlement follows the agreed off-chain outcome.
•	Arc as Unified Liquidity Pool: By using Arc, all users’ funds reside on one chain for settlement, which avoids liquidity being split across networks. Arc’s role as a liquidity hub for USDC means that we can aggregate a large pool of bettors in one place, increasing market depth and fairness. Arc is designed to “ignite liquidity across currencies and chains”, and RetroPick showcases this by allowing, say, an Ethereum user and a Polygon user to both deposit USDC into Arc and bet in the same market without either having to switch their base chain permanently[5][6]. This chain-agnostic design (sometimes called “chain abstraction”) is a core part of our architecture – it means RetroPick isn’t an app tied to one ecosystem, but rather a cross-chain dApp where Arc plays the role of the clearinghouse. In essence, Arc + Yellow together function much like a traditional betting exchange’s backend: Arc is the ledger that finalizes money movement, and Yellow is the trading engine handling rapid bets.
•	Testnet Faucet Contract: For demo purposes, we will deploy a simple faucet contract on Arc’s testnet (since Arc is new, users might not easily get test USDC). The faucet will dispense a small amount of test USDC (or a mock stablecoin) to any user wallet for free, allowing judges and users to quickly get funds to try the platform. This is important to ensure a smooth demo – anyone can come to RetroPick, click “Get Test Tokens”, receive e.g. 100 mockUSDC, and start placing bets immediately. It showcases the end-to-end flow without requiring complicated setup.
3. Cross-Chain Bridge Integration
To truly treat multiple chains as one, RetroPick will integrate Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) via Bridge Kit (or alternatively, a bridging aggregator like LI.FI, time permitting) for moving USDC onto and off of Arc:
•	Seamless Deposits from Any Chain: A user on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, etc. can initiate a deposit into RetroPick without manually going through Arc’s wallet setup. Using Circle’s BridgeKit (which supports Arc Testnet[13][13]), the dApp will provide a UI for the user to send USDC from their home chain to Arc. Under the hood, CCTP will burn USDC on the source chain and mint the equivalent USDC on Arc into the custody contract address[5]. This process is abstracted in a few clicks, so the user experience might be: “Select origin chain -> approve/send USDC -> wait ~1 minute -> funds arrive on Arc and your RetroPick balance is updated.” Crucially, this bridging step does not require trust in a third-party bridge – it’s Circle’s native mechanism, so it’s secure and aligned with Arc’s infrastructure. By integrating this, we directly fulfill Arc’s cross-chain liquidity mandate (moving USDC onto Arc as needed).
•	Withdrawals to Users’ Preferred Chains: Likewise, when a user is done and wants to withdraw winnings, we use the same CCTP/BridgeKit in reverse. The user can choose their target chain, and our contract will initiate a burn of USDC on Arc which triggers Circle to mint USDC on the target chain to the user’s address. In practice, we might implement this by having an in-app withdrawal request that calls Circle’s Gateway/Bridge contracts. The result is that even though the actual betting and settlement happened on Arc, the user is not “stuck” on Arc – they can fluidly come and go with their money. This makes RetroPick very user-friendly: it “treats multiple chains as one” from the user’s perspective, as they just use USDC and the app handles where it goes[6].
•	Optional LI.FI Composer (Stretch Goal): If time allows, we might incorporate the LI.FI SDK for an even more generalized cross-chain onramp. LI.FI could enable a one-click swap from any token on any chain into USDC on Arc. For example, a user could swap ETH on Ethereum directly for USDC on Arc in one step via LI.FI’s routing. This would broaden accessibility (users aren’t required to already hold USDC; they could use other assets). It could also qualify for LI.FI’s prize by demonstrating a real DeFi cross-chain workflow. However, given complexity, the primary plan is to use Circle’s native solution which is tailor-made for USDC and Arc.
By implementing cross-chain deposit and withdrawal, RetroPick ensures it truly operates as a chain-abstracted dApp. This architecture means we meet Arc’s qualification (using Arc + Circle tech) while offering a seamless experience across ecosystems.
4. Frontend Application & ENS Integration
The user-facing side of RetroPick ties everything together and ensures a smooth experience:
•	Web DApp Interface: We will build a web-based DApp that connects to users’ wallets (MetaMask, etc.). When a user visits, they can login with their wallet or ENS name. The interface will detect if the user is on an unsupported network and prompt them to bridge (as described above). Once funded, the UI shows available prediction markets, odds, and a trading interface (similar to a betting exchange or prediction market UI).
•	Using Yellow SDK: The frontend uses the Yellow SDK to establish the off-chain session. For example, when a user joins a market, the app will call YellowSDK.createSession(wallet, arcProvider, sessionParams) which triggers the deposit transaction (locking funds in the Arc contract) and opens the channel. From that point, user actions like “Bet Team A wins 10 USDC at 2:1 odds” are handled by calling Yellow SDK methods that send signed messages to the Yellow Clearnode. The state updates (new odds, your new balance, etc.) are then instantly pushed to the UI. Essentially, the front-end is always listening for state changes from Yellow’s off-chain network (perhaps via webSockets or SDK callbacks) to update the market view in real-time.
•	Real-Time UX: Thanks to the off-chain design, the app can display instantaneous feedback – e.g., the moment you place a bet, your available balance decreases and the market odds might adjust, all without waiting for a block confirmation. We’ll make the UI highlight this smoothness (perhaps a counter of “Gas fees saved” or the speed of execution) to drive home the benefit. This is where Yellow gives a Web2-like feel: from the user’s perspective, it’s like the transaction “just worked” immediately, but in the background it’s secured by cryptography and will settle later on-chain.
•	ENS Name Display: If the user’s wallet has an ENS name, the app will show that (e.g., “Welcome, alice.eth”) to personalize the experience. We’ll also allow users to input ENS names for sending funds or referring friends. Additionally, for a creative ENS touch, the DApp could automatically mint a subdomain for each new user or market. For instance, if our main ENS is retropick.eth, when a new market “CryptoPriceUp” is created, we register cryptopriceup.retropick.eth and store the market’s metadata or outcome URL in its ENS text records. This way, the ENS serves as a human-readable identifier for the market that anyone can look up. It’s a novel use of ENS in DeFi – using naming not just for addresses but for market instruments – aligning with ENS’s encouragement to “get creative” with integrations beyond just address resolution[14]. All ENS interactions will be done through standard libraries (e.g., Etherscan’s ENS functions) and we’ll ensure no values are hard-coded (truly resolving names live).
•	Outcome Resolution & Oracle: A critical part of the workflow is how a prediction market is resolved. In our architecture, we plan a semi-decentralized approach for the hackathon demo: an “Oracle” account (or simple oracle contract) will publish the outcome when the event concludes. For example, if the market was “Will ETH price be above $2000 on Dec 31?”, after Dec 31, our oracle (could be a Chainlink node or even a trusted backend for demo) will call the Market Resolution contract on Arc with the result (YES or NO). The off-chain session will already have ended by then (we might design the session to auto-close at event deadline), so the contract can now finalize payouts based on the last channel state. In future, this oracle could be decentralized or use a service like UMA’s optimistic oracles for trustlessness. But for now, we ensure the mechanism is clear and transparent in the demo (perhaps showing that we used a reliable data source).
•	Session Closure & Payout: Once the oracle triggers settlement, the Yellow channel contract on Arc will release funds. Technically, this could involve the oracle providing the final state hash signed by participants, or simply instructing the contract to distribute according to a predetermined logic (if the market was binary, all stakes on the losing side go to fund the winning side payouts). Users will then see on the UI that the market is closed and payouts are available. They can then withdraw their funds (either keep on Arc or bridge back out as described).
The architecture emphasizes a clear separation of concerns: off-chain for speed and user interaction, on-chain for security and final value transfer. By using modern solutions at each layer (Yellow for L2, Arc for L1, Circle for bridging, ENS for naming), RetroPick achieves something unique: a decentralized app with the performance of a centralized exchange and the connectivity of a multi-chain ecosystem.
Workflow Summary: To illustrate, here’s a typical user flow in RetroPick:
1.	User Onboarding: User visits the RetroPick DApp and connects their wallet. If they have no funds on Arc, they choose a source chain (e.g. Ethereum) and an amount. The app uses Circle’s Bridge to transfer, say, 50 USDC from Ethereum to Arc. In one minute, the user now has 50 USDC available on Arc (visible in the DApp).
2.	Opening a Session: The user selects a prediction market (e.g. “BTC > $30k by month-end”). The Yellow SDK prompts them to deposit into the channel – this calls Arc’s custody contract to lock their 50 USDC and open a state channel tied to this market session. (Under the hood, this might be one transaction on Arc.) Once confirmed, an off-chain session is established and the user’s off-chain balance is 50 USDC in that market.
3.	Placing Bets Off-Chain: The user places a bet of 20 USDC on “Yes”. This action is signed and sent to the Yellow network. Instantly, the user’s off-chain balance goes to 30 USDC (20 locked in the bet) and the market odds update. Another user across the world could simultaneously bet on “No”; Yellow’s off-chain protocol handles these updates in real time, matching bets or updating odds through an off-chain AMM. The two users may trade positions multiple times before the deadline – all these trades happen with zero gas and instantaneous confirmation.
4.	Closing Session & Settlement: When the market’s time is up (or the user manually exits early), the session closes. No more bets are accepted. The final state of the channel now reflects each user’s net position (e.g. User A should end with X USDC, User B with Y USDC depending on wins/losses). The outcome oracle then submits the result on-chain (e.g., “BTC > $30k: YES”). Given the outcome, the predetermined logic or final state signatures are used to calculate payouts. A transaction is sent to Arc’s contracts to finalize settlement: winners’ balances are increased accordingly and losers’ deposits are decremented. Each user can now withdraw their remaining funds from the contract. Suppose our user won and now has 80 USDC on Arc.
5.	Withdrawal: The user decides to take their 80 USDC back to their preferred chain. They initiate a withdrawal in the DApp, choosing Ethereum. This calls Circle’s protocol to burn 80 USDC on Arc and mint 80 USDC to the user’s Ethereum address. Within a minute or so, the user sees 80 USDC in their Ethereum wallet. The prediction market round is fully settled and closed out, with on-chain record of the outcome on Arc and each user’s final funds back in their possession on whatever chain they prefer.
Throughout this flow, ENS names make it easy to identify participants (e.g. the interface might show “bettor: alice.eth vs bettor: bob.eth” in a head-to-head market), and even the markets themselves could be referenced by name. The user never needed to worry about Arc-specific tokens or complicated bridging – RetroPick handled the heavy lifting, courtesy of Arc’s seamless USDC handling and Yellow’s off-chain magic.
This architecture is scalable (adding more markets just means deploying more instances or handling more sessions concurrently) and secure (funds are always in smart contracts when not in motion, and final outcomes are enforced by those contracts). It also provides a blueprint for expanding to more chains: since Yellow is compatible with all EVM chains and even Solana soon[15], we could deploy the channel contracts on other chains over time, effectively creating local “entry points” that all connect to the same off-chain network. But in the hackathon scope, using Arc as the primary on-chain environment is sufficient and advantageous.
Value Proposition and Market Impact
RetroPick’s unique combination of technologies yields a compelling value proposition for users and the broader DeFi/gaming market:
•	🔄 Real-Time, Low-Cost Trading: RetroPick enables a form of prediction market and trading that was previously impractical on-chain. Users get real-time interactivity – you can rapidly adjust your positions or react to news instantly, without waiting for block confirmations. And since off-chain bets incur no gas, micro-transactions are viable. Betting $0.01 on many outcomes or making dozens of rapid-fire trades won’t be eaten by fees[3]. This opens the door to new behaviors (think of in-play sports betting or rapid markets on live events) that on-chain platforms like Augur or even Polygon-based markets couldn’t support due to latency and cost. RetroPick delivers the speed of centralized betting exchanges while keeping the non-custodial, trustless nature** of DeFi.
•	🌐 Cross-Chain Accessibility with Stablecoins: By leveraging Arc and USDC, RetroPick is chain-agnostic and user-friendly. A user on any major chain can participate without complex steps – essentially “bring your USDC and play.” There’s no need to manage multiple volatile currencies for gas or maintain wallets on multiple networks. USDC acts as the common currency, and Arc’s bridging means moving funds in or out is quick and secure[5]. This unified liquidity is a huge advantage: existing prediction markets are often siloed (one on Ethereum, one on Polygon, etc., each with separate liquidity pools). RetroPick’s pool of liquidity is shared across all users, which improves market efficiency (tighter spreads, better odds) and deepens the payout reserves, making it more attractive for larger players. In essence, RetroPick could become a one-stop platform for global crypto users to bet on outcomes, rather than splitting them by chain. Arc’s design ensures this is done with compliance and speed in mind – for example, deterministic finality on Arc means users can trust that once the outcome is settled, their funds are final (no lengthy confirms or risk of chain reorgs).
•	🔐 Security & Trust Advantages: Users retain custody of their funds throughout the process. This is a major selling point versus centralized betting platforms or prediction exchanges where you must deposit funds into a company’s wallet. With RetroPick, the funds are either in a smart contract under your control or moving through Circle’s secure bridge or locked in a state channel that you can unilaterally close. There’s no scenario where RetroPick can rehypothecate or lose your money – even a catastrophic failure of the off-chain network would result in users recovering their assets on-chain[11]. This trustless architecture will appeal to the growing segment of users wary of centralized exchanges or casinos, especially after various custodial failures in crypto. Moreover, all transactions and settlements are transparent on Arc’s blockchain, providing auditability. In terms of Oracle trust (for outcomes), we plan to use reputable data sources; as the platform matures, we can decentralize this further (using multiple oracles or community voting with bonds, etc.). The combination of provable fairness (via open-source smart contracts) and instant gratification (via off-chain execution) is powerful – it’s like provably-fair gaming meets high-frequency trading.
•	💻 Web2-Grade UX in Web3: RetroPick aims to bridge Web2 and Web3 in user experience. Integrations like ENS for naming, and abstracting away network complexity (thanks to Arc and bridging), mean that an average user might not even realize which chain they’re using. They just know they’re using USDC and it’s fast and works. This lowers the entry barrier for non-crypto or casual users. For instance, a user could log in with a social wallet that has an ENS already, click a few buttons to deposit via credit card (Circle could enable fiat onramp into Arc USDC), and start betting – all in a couple of minutes. We’re essentially following Web2 product design principles (speed, simplicity, familiarity) while harnessing Web3 under the hood (self-custody, censorship-resistance, global reach). This positions RetroPick well in the market as a next-generation dApp that doesn’t sacrifice UX for decentralization. By showcasing such a smooth experience, RetroPick could attract not just crypto enthusiasts, but also gamblers and gamers who’ve never used Web3 before.
•	📈 Market Opportunity & Business Model: The prediction market and online betting industry is massive, but decentralized alternatives have yet to capture significant share – largely due to UX and scalability issues. RetroPick directly tackles those issues. The value proposition to users is clear (better UX, no middlemen, potentially better odds due to lower fees), which can drive adoption. For a sustainable business model, RetroPick can implement a small platform fee on winnings or bets (far smaller than traditional bookies’ cut). Because transactions are off-chain, fees can be taken into account during settlement (e.g., take 1% of the pot before distribution) in a transparent way. Given the reduced cost overhead (no gas per bet), even a tiny fee can be profitable without burdening users. Additionally, RetroPick could issue its own token or use outcome tokens for governance, but that’s beyond the hackathon scope. In the long run, volumes in prediction markets could be high if the experience rivals centralized platforms. RetroPick’s architecture is built to scale: adding more users or markets mainly involves spinning up more off-chain channels and ensuring liquidity, which is much easier than scaling L1 transactions. This means it can grow without hitting the usual blockchain bottlenecks.
•	🤝 Competitive Edge: Compared to existing solutions, RetroPick stands out. Platforms like Augur (an early Ethereum prediction market) suffered from very slow trading (each trade was an Ethereum txn) and poor UX – RetroPick would offer a far superior experience. Other newer platforms (PolyMarket, etc.) use faster chains or sidechains, but they still incur a transaction per trade and silo users by chain. RetroPick, by using state channels, essentially leapfrogs them by removing per-trade on-chain transactions altogether, and by using Arc/Circle, it avoids siloing and leverages a regulated stablecoin environment (important for larger bettors or institutions who might want to participate knowing the stablecoin is robust). There is also a trend of centralized betting platforms exploring crypto; RetroPick could capture that interest by providing an experience that’s just as fast but non-custodial. In summary, our value prop is “Fast like Web2, Fair like Web3.” That message can resonate strongly in the market.
•	🌱 Future Potential: Beyond just a hackathon project, RetroPick has room to grow. The architecture we’ve built – state channels + stablecoin L1 + bridging – could extend to other applications (real-time trading of tokenized assets, gaming rewards, etc.). RetroPick could become a platform or protocol other dApps integrate, for example providing an API for games to create instant wager markets inside their game (leveraging our channels). This hints at a broader value: we’re showcasing a blueprint for scalable DeFi apps. Given Yellow’s and Arc’s backing (e.g., Arc involving major institutions[16]), there’s an ecosystem push for exactly these kinds of real-world scalable finance apps. RetroPick aligns with that vision, showing how stablecoins + L2 tech can bring Web3 to real-world scale.
In conclusion, RetroPick’s value proposition is delivering an unprecedented user experience in decentralized prediction markets by combining the strengths of multiple cutting-edge solutions. It offers instant, feeless betting secured by smart contracts, unified liquidity via Arc’s cross-chain USDC (making it easy for anyone to join), and a user-friendly touch with ENS and familiar Web2-like responsiveness. This makes RetroPick not just a strong hackathon project targeting multiple prize tracks, but also a potentially disruptive product in the market. It addresses a clear problem (slow, expensive, siloed prediction markets) with a creative solution (off-chain state channels + cross-chain stablecoin settlement), and it does so in a way that is technically sound and aligned with where the Web3 infrastructure is heading. By focusing on Yellow, Arc, and ENS, we ensure the architecture is deeply analyzed and well-architected for both hackathon judging and real-world viability. RetroPick could very well be the first “fast finance” dApp that makes something like prediction markets truly accessible and enjoyable for the mainstream – a showcase of how to blend the best of Web2 speed with Web3 trust.
